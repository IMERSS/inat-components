The [inat-components repo](https://github.com/IMERSS/inat-components) contains some pre-built React components to
display iNaturalist data on your own sites. The original goal was to provide add an 
[interactive page to the BC Lepidoptera website](https://bcleps.weebly.com/inat.html) so visitors could see some
high-level information about lepidoptera (butterflies and moths) spotted in British Columbia. But the code
was written to allow it to be re-used by any website and for any taxon or place.

This specific package is only the React components, plus a standalone.min.js file for 

Please see the [main documentation](https://github.com/IMERSS/inat-components) for more information on the script, 
including the standalone version.
