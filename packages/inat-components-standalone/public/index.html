<h1>Standalone example</h1>

<p>
    This is a simple HTML page to let you experiment with the configuration. Just edit the
    <code>./packages/inat-components-standalone/public/index.html</code> file and refresh the page after a second or so.
</p>

<hr size="1" />

<div id="panel"></div>

<style>
    /* some general styles to make the page look less than awful */
    body {
        font-family: verdana;
        font-size: 12px;
    }

    /*
    This block provides an example of how to style the various elements. It's not intended to be pretty - it's just to
    give you an idea of how the styles can be applied. The classnames themselves are entirely up to you: just change them
    here and in the JS `generalClasses` configuration below.

    The component includes its own styles for some things to abstract away things like layout, positioning, and providing
    a few base styles so it doesn't look too awful out the box. So in a couple of cases you'll need to increase the
    specificity on your rule to overwrite what you need, as illustrated below.

    -- TODO
        - this one isn't working: "inat-tab-desc"
        - give examples of all the other styling too, e.g. the summary page things.

    .inat-tabs li {
        color: red;
    }
    .inat-tabs li:nth-child(3) {
        color: white;
        background-color: green;
    }
    .inat-years-dropdown {
        border: 5px solid red;
    }
    h1.inat-page-headings {
        border-bottom: 6px solid pink;
    }
    .inat-observation-label-title {
        color: blueviolet;
    }
    .inat-observation-label-data {
        color: yellowgreen;
    }
    .inat-observation-label-name a {
        color: deeppink;
    }
    */
</style>
