## Developer notes

First, let's get it all going.

1. Clone the repo
2. In the root folder, run `nvm install` to ensure you're running the compatible version of node (see NVM for more info on that command).
3. run `yarn install` 
4. run `yarn boot`
5. run `yarn build`

Other root monorepo commands:

- `yarn standalone` - starts up a watcher for the standalone script and loads `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to play around with it.
